# Flutter Agent Starter

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/overview/) that provides a simple voice interface using the [LiveKit Flutter SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-flutter).

This template is compatible with iOS, macOS, Android, and web. It is free for you to use or modify as you see fit.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get this app running is with the [Sandbox for LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox) and the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup/).

First, create a new [Sandbox Token Server](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/token-server) for your LiveKit Cloud project.

Then, run the following command to automatically clone this template and connect it to LiveKit Cloud.

```bash
lk app create --template agent-starter-flutter --sandbox <token_server_sandbox_id>
```

Install dependencies and run the app:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Note: You may need to configure signing certificates in Xcode if building to a real iOS device.

You'll also need an agent to speak with. Try our starter agent for [Python](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-node), or [create your own from scratch](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/).

> [!NOTE]
> To setup without the LiveKit CLI, clone the repository and then either create a `.env` with a `LIVEKIT_SANDBOX_ID` (if using a [Sandbox Token Server](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/token-server)), or open `token_service.dart` and add your [manually generated](#token-generation) URL and token.

## Token generation

In a production environment, you will be responsible for developing a solution to [generate tokens for your users](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/generating-tokens/) which is integrated with your authentication solution. You should disable your sandbox token server and modify `token_service.dart` to use your own token server.
