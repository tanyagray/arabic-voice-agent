-- Seed data for development and testing
-- This file is optional and can be used to populate the database with test data

-- Note: In production, this file should not be run.
-- User data will be created via actual user signups.

-- Example: Insert common event types for analytics tracking
-- (This is just for reference - events are created dynamically)

-- Common event types that will be tracked:
-- - conversation_start
-- - conversation_end
-- - message_sent
-- - voice_call_started
-- - voice_call_ended
-- - mode_switched (text <-> voice)
-- - dialect_preference_changed
-- - profile_updated

-- No seed data required for production
-- All data is user-generated through the application
